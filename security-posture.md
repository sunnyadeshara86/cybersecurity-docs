# Security posture

Over the years, security investments have transitioned from being optional to essential. Today, organizations worldwide recognize the critical importance of consistently investing in security measures. Such investment is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in the market. Neglecting to adequately protect their assets can result in irreparable harm and, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy. Given the current threat landscape, merely investing in protection is insufficient. Organizations must improve their overall security posture, ensuring that investments in protection, detection, and response are well-coordinated. In this topic, we will explore the following topics:

## The present threat landscape

### The current cybersecurity threat landscape in 2024 is characterized by increased sophistication and diversity in attack vectors. Key trends include:

- Rise in Stealthy Attacks: Adversaries are leveraging stealth techniques to bypass traditional detection systems. They use valid credentials and legitimate tools, making it difficult for defenders to distinguish between normal and malicious activities. These attacks are quick, often successful within minutes​ [(CrowdStrike)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/global-threat-report/).
- Cloud Intrusions and Identity-Based Attacks: With the widespread adoption of cloud services, attackers are focusing on cloud environments, using stolen credentials to gain access. Identity threats have surged, facilitated by generative AI which aids in phishing and social engineering attacks​ [(CrowdStrike)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/global-threat-report/).
- Advanced Malware and Ransomware: Malware has evolved to include polymorphic and metamorphic variants, which can alter their code to evade detection. Additionally, ransomware has advanced, with tactics like double extortion becoming more common, where data is not only encrypted but also threatened to be leaked if demands are not met​ [(Secure Password Manager)](https://nordpass.com/blog/cybersecurity-trends-2024/).
- Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Attacks on supply chains have increased, with adversaries exploiting relationships between vendors and clients to maximize their impact. This strategy allows them to compromise multiple organizations through a single point of entry​ [(Secure Password Manager)​](https://nordpass.com/blog/cybersecurity-trends-2024/).
